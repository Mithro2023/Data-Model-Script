Using MySQL Workbench, I designed and implemented a comprehensive database schema for a manufacturing and distribution company. The project involved creating a normalized relational database with multiple interconnected tables, including Products, Customers, Orders, RawMaterials, Vendors, and Employees. I ensured robust data integrity by defining primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints, while also incorporating business-specific relationships such as product usage, order lines, and employee certifications. This project highlights my expertise in database design, SQL scripting, and implementing relationships to support complex data structures.
